## Intro

Trying out a blog for non-work stuff, apart from practicing git and markdown and jekyll and whatnot. Not sure what I will or won't throw in here but I've recently jumped back on Spotify (sorry Neil) and after reading Surrender I had the itch to revisit U2's albums. And I like ranking things (pathetic, I know) so I'll try that as a way to kickstart whatever this is. I'm going to listen to each album 10 times.

I'll rate the albums on tracklisting too, or just how coherently it works as an album which has always been important to me when listening to music.

Qualifier: There will be a *lot* more informed and better written things on U2 than my wibblings here. Is wibblings a word?

## The Unforgettable Fire

Not sure why I started here but I did.  This one was a blind spot, relatively speaking. I owned it on cassette in the early 90s so I *must* have listened to it a decent number of times back then but some of the lesser known tracks here were very unfamiliar to my ears.

#### A Sort of Homecoming

Jesus. What an opener. I knew this song of course but it had been a while since I really listened to it. Bono's vocals are off the scale. As they are on the whole album. In between his early english-punk style affectations and the later american twang. Has he written a better lyric? I'm not sure. The title paraphrases Paul Celan who said "Poetry is a sort of homecoming" and Bono's impressionistic lyrics create some arresting sketches of places and feelings.

> The city walls are all come down
>
> The dust a smoke screen all around
>
> See faces ploughed like fields that once
>
> Gave no resistance

Just gorgeous. Up their with their best opening tracks.

9/10

#### Pride (In The Name Of Love)

It's all about the drumming. The way it pushes into every "in the naaame" like a train. This is clearly 'Big' U2. Not my favourite type of U2, and particularly on this album I prefer the songs that are less sure of what they are, less quick to declare themselves. But you can't deny its power, from that three note opening. It is a bit hard to hear the song properly, it feels like trying to see a table for the first time. God I'm talking shite.

7.5/10

#### Wire

A bit of a comedown after the first two. But I like it.

#### The Unforgettable Fire

A perfect song. A band finding a new sound.

10/10

#### Promenade

Lovely song. Bono and Ali had moved into a Martello tower in Bray
