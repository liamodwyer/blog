## Intro

Trying out a blog for non-work stuff, apart from practicing git and markdown and jekyll and whatnot. Not sure what I will or won't throw in here but I've recently jumped back on Spotify (sorry Neil) and after reading Surrender I had the itch to revisit U2's albums. And I like ranking things (pathetic, I know) so I'll try that as a way to kickstart whatever this is. I'm going to listen to each album 10 times.

I'll rate the albums on tracklisting too, or just how coherently it works as an album which has always been important to me when listening to music.

Qualifier: There will be a *lot* more informed and better written things on U2 than my wibblings here. Is wibblings a word?

## The Unforgettable Fire

Not sure why I started here but I did.  This one was a blind spot, relatively speaking. I owned it on cassette in the early 90s so I *must* have listened to it a decent number of times back then but some of the lesser known tracks here were very unfamiliar to my ears.

#### A Sort of Homecoming

Jesus. What an opener. I knew this song of course but it had been a while since I really listened to it. Bono's vocals are off the scale. As they are on the whole album. In between his early english-punk style affectations and the later american twang. 

And has he written a better lyric? I'm not sure. The title paraphrases Paul Celan who said "Poetry is a sort of homecoming" and Bono's impressionistic style creates beautiful, arresting sketches of places and feelings, of foundations giving way, of some things coming apart and some things staying together.

The tune isn't bad either. 

Just gorgeous. Up their with their best opening tracks.

9.5/10

#### Pride (In The Name Of Love)

It's all about the drumming. The way it pushes into every "in the naaame" like a train. This is clearly 'Big' U2. Not my favourite type of U2, and particularly on this album I prefer the songs that are less sure of what they are, less quick to declare themselves. But you can't deny its power, from that three note opening. It is a bit hard to hear the song properly, it feels like trying to see a table for the first time. God I'm talking shite.

7.5/10

#### Wire

A bit of a comedown after the first two. But I like it.

#### The Unforgettable Fire

A perfect song. A band finding a new sound.

10/10

#### Promenade

Lovely song. Bono and Ali had moved into a Martello tower in Bray 

#### Indian Summer Sky

More soaring vocals but the weird backing vocal underneath just sounds...well, weird. And annoying. The lyrical imagery is a bit half baked too. I'm not sure is it when there's a stronger tune underneath it gives these broad-stroke images more heft. Whatever, they just sound unfinished here. Not the best. I like the part around 3:50 where Bono comes in over himself but then 

#### Elvis Presley and America 

Underrated. Bono's vocals are very odd, sounds like he could have done with another take or three. And the guitars go out the door and come back in for no clear reason in a few places. And the volume is all over the shop. It sounds like they are figuring it out as they go along, more like an extended jam than a song. But that's kind of why I like it. Everything in later U2 is rerecorded and overthought to within an inch of its life. Here it sounds like a peek into their studio process, Bono scatting and experimenting, Edge finding things that work and things that don't, Larry driving the car through the rain and Adam bringing the cans. This album sounds rushed in places but it gives it an energy that How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb would kill for. In opinion.

6.5/10

#### MLK
