## The Unforgettable Fire

Not sure why I started here but I did. I'm going to listen to all of U2's album's 10 times and do a ranking. This one was a blind spot, relatively speaking. I owned it on cassette in the early 90s so I *must* have listened to it a decent number of times back then but some of the lesser known tracks here were *very* unfamiliar to my 40-something ears. Anyway, I'll do a track-by-track for each album so here goes...

#### A Sort of Homecoming

Jesus. What an opener. I mean I of course knew this song but it had been a while since I listened to it. Bono's vocals are off the scale. As they are on the whole album, perfectly caught between his early english-punk style affectations and the later american stadium yawp. And has he written a better lyric? I'm not sure. Gorgeous song. Jesus. What an opener.
9/10

#### Pride (In The Name Of Love)

It's all about the drumming. The way it pushes into every chorus like a train. Not my favourite type of U2, and particularly on this album I prefer the songs that are less sure of what they are, less quick to declare themselves. But you can't deny its power, from that three note opening. It is a bit hard to hear the song properly, it feels like trying to see a table for the first time. God I'm talking shite.
7.5/10

#### Wire



#### The Unforgettable Fire

A perfect song. The sound of a band finding a new sound.
10/10
